                  Driving Economic Transformation and Growth in BRICS and the Global South.<br>
                  Welcome to Sovereign Africa Ratings (SAR), a local African agency based in South Africa. We are proud to be distinct from the three major rating agencies, bringing a fresh and unique approach to evaluating economic potential and performance. SAR's analytical approach emphasises objective assets, such as natural resources, while maintaining a cautious perspective on subjective political and economic agency dictates.
                  Sovereign Africa Ratings (Pty) Ltd (SAR) is a licensed credit rating service provider with a focus on sovereign, regional and municipal government, corporate, and Sukuk rating services. It is driven by the principles of efficiency and world-class technical competencies. SAR was formed to satisfy developmental and investment needs in Africa and emerging markets in general. It is an organisation committed to excellence in providing credit ratings to its clients throughout the continent and the developing world.
                  SAR asserts that the needs of emerging markets are unique, and that the length of time it has taken for economic transformation to be realised on a large scale indicates the need for more plurality in the provision of quality economic research, creditworthiness opinion, and linked market insights. SAR’s mission is to offer such insights with unerring market relevance and statistical and economic accuracy.
